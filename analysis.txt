From Figure 1, it can be seen that Industrious Mass Ave. and Launch Indy are equal in how many events are within two miles of their locations.
However, through comparison of the histograms in Figures 2 and 3, it can be seen that events are typically slightly closer to Industrious Mass Ave.
Therefore, Industrial Mass Ave. would be the ideal location to have the most available options for events.

An ideal conference for this location would be the APIC conference at the Indiana Convention Center. This would be happening from June 13-15, so it's at an ideal
time in the summer.

From the surrounding area, there are plenty of unique restaurants, but only 10 need to be selected. Ignoring strictly bars in the event of age restrictions, the closest 10 are:
Bazbeaux Pizza
The Eagle on Mass Ave.
Bru Burger Bar
Union 50
Fogo de Chao Brazilian Steakhouse
Vida
The Capital Grille
Mesh
The Oceanaire Seafood Room
Livery

5 events are needed, with one every other week. Going off of nearby events, 5 are:
Indianapolis Chamber Orchestra: 5-22
Wallows Concert: 6-07
Talbot Street Art Fair: 6-18
Barenaked Ladies Concert: 7-01
5 Seconds of Summer with The Band Camino Concert: 7-15

Given these, a proposed 10 week schedule can be created. See the spreadsheet in the repo for the shcedule.
